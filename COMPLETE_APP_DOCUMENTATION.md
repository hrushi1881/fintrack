# **FINTRACK - COMPLETE APP DOCUMENTATION**

## **What is FinTrack?**

FinTrack is a comprehensive personal finance management application designed to give you complete control and clarity over your financial life. Unlike traditional banking apps that show you a single balance number, FinTrack uses an innovative **Fund Segregation System** that separates your money into different categories, helping you understand exactly what you can spend, what's reserved for debts, and what's saved for goals.

**The Core Philosophy:** Your account balance isn't just one number—it's a collection of different funds with different purposes. FinTrack makes this visible and manageable.

### **2.4 The Fund System - How It Works**

This is FinTrack's unique feature that sets it apart from other finance apps.

**The Problem It Solves:**
Imagine you have ₹50,000 in your checking account. But ₹20,000 is set aside for next month's rent, ₹10,000 is for a car loan payment, and ₹8,000 is saved for a vacation. Traditional apps show ₹50,000 and you think you can spend it all—but you can't!

**The FinTrack Solution:**
Your ₹50,000 is automatically organized into separate funds:

**Personal Fund** (₹12,000)
- Your actual spending money
- What's left after setting aside for liabilities and goals
- This is what you can actually spend freely

**Liability Fund - Car Loan** (₹10,000)
- Money reserved for your car loan payment
- Protected from accidental spending
- Only used for that specific liability

**Goal Fund - Vacation** (₹8,000)
- Money saved for your vacation goal
- Locked and protected
- Cannot be spent directly

**Liability Fund - Rent** (₹20,000)
- Money set aside for rent
- Reserved for that specific purpose

**Result:** You see your **Personal Fund balance (₹12,000)** as your "Available to Spend" amount, not the misleading total (₹50,000).

---
